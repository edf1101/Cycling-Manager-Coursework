# Notes
_General notes abt the Coursework_

- Test files don't need to be submitted and aren't marked
- Are Race IDs unique compared to stage ids etc? How are things like getStageData etc accessed by only the stage ID
- MiniInterface line 251 theres error from bad impl ? that no int is returned for a func wanting an Int return
- Check deepcopy Datetimes etc
- Bad portals can go
- No equal times
- Referal to just "points" is for the stage finish position and intermediate sprints
- for judging elapsed time, when you squash it down in case of a peloton can use a better algorithm than an n^2 one.
- We are supposed to hardcode the points lists ourselves https://ele.exeter.ac.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=231194
- Wont test if a stage starts late at night eg 22:00 and finishes early morn eg 6:00 but good to add
- Helpful vid explaining concept of Tour de France https://ele.exeter.ac.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=227192
- Complete all interface messages within Portal
- when adding a stage the average gradient is descriptive and doesn't actually affect the data
- Check the previous implementations for the portal etc
- Think carefully about side affects of reusing or not reusing IDs
- Need assertions for marks
- Stages before preparation is concluded must be 'not ready' or sumn like that check online
